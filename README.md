# Basic Source of Randomness Attack Project

This project demonstrates a source of randomness attack in solidity. It shows why you should put your on-chain because it will be vulnerable.

## Preventions

Don't use 'blockhash', 'block.timestamp', or really any sort of on-chain data as sources of randomness
You can use 'Chainlink VRF's 'for true source of randomness
